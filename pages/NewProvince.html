                            <h5>Origin of the Khrist Jyoti Province</h5>
                            <h4>
                                The society of the Catholic Apostolate is an International Community of priests and
                                brothers founded by a Roman Priest, St. Vincent Pallotti (1795 – 1850). From his name it
                                receives its popular name “Pallottines”. Today Pallottines carry out the mission of
                                bringing together all the people for the purpose of spreading the Good News throughout
                                the World. Khrist Jyothi Province is one of the three Pallottine Entities in India
                                carrying out the original vision of the Founder in the remote missions of India.
                            </h4>

                            <h4>
                                January 6, 2002 was a historical moment for the Pallottines in India when the existing
                                Prabhu Prakash Province was transformed into two provinces and an autonomous Region
                                during a solemn Eucharistic Celebration presided over by Very Rev. Fr. Seamus Freeman,
                                the Rector General of the Society of the Catholic Apostolate, at Pallottine Animation
                                Centre, Nagpur. Thus the two new Provinces and a Region came into existence. The new
                                Regime formally took charge on the same day. The First Regional Council led by Very Rev.
                                Fr. Arogyadas Kottana, SAC, the Regional Superior, Fr. Marianus Xaxa SAC, the first
                                Consultor and Fr. Arogyanadhan David SAC, the Consultor headed the Khrist Jyoti Region
                                towards its progress and development. The Regional Superior, after due consultations
                                with his members announced the name of the new Region which is Lumen Christi and in
                                Hindi, it reads Khrist Jyoti Region.
                            </h4>

                            <h4>
                                Since its erection on 6th January 2002 the Khrist Jyoti Region has witnessed three
                                Regional Administrations. The second Regional Administration (June 2005 – June – 2008)
                                was headed by Very Rev. Fr. Binay Bhushan Barwa SAC, the Regional Superior, Rev. Fr.
                                Shanti Prakash Panna, the First Consultor and Rev. Fr. Sebenius Kujur, the Consultor.
                                The Third Regional Administration (June 2008 – December 2011) was headed by Very Rev.
                                Fr. Arogyadas Kottana SAC, the Regional Superior, Rev. Fr. Shanti Prakash Panna, the
                                First Consultor and Rev. Fr. John Sobha Sunder, Rev. Fr. Benjamin Behera, Rev. Fr. Louis
                                Tete, the Consultors.

                            <h4>
                                The Official Visitation of The General Council to the Khrist Jyoti Region from 10th to
                                22nd July 2011 was a historical moment for the Region. The General Council is convinced
                                that the Khrist Jyoti Region has grown a lot ever since its erection on 6th January 2002
                                in terms of the number of members, the variety of apostolic tasks, the quality of
                                formation of members and the possibilities for economic self-sufficiency. Therefore, the
                                General Council, in its session on 2nd September 2011, has decided to establish the
                                Khrist Jyoti Region as a Province of the Society in accordance with Law of SAC 311 & 312
                                on 22nd December 2011.
                            </h4>

                            <h4>
                                The Pallottine community is fortunate to observe the dawn of another Province rising in
                                the horizon. It is the transformation of Khrist Jyoti Region into Khrist Jyoti Province.
                                No sooner the constitution was amended in the last General assembly the outgoing council
                                set to work for the Region to be transformed into a Province. In our attempts we
                                experienced a strong support of the Rector General who saw to it that it took the
                                shortest period of time. It is through his efforts and hard work that our Region is
                                erected as a Province today.

                                Every new Institution, in order to grow and develop, requires a suitable environment, a
                                good financial back up, adequate Personnel, efficient management and proper orientation.
                                This was true for the new born Region too. Therefore, the Region had four Regional
                                Assemblies and three Congresses since 2002 until now (2011). The First Regional Assembly
                                of the Region was convened from 6 – 8 January 2002 at Pallotti Ashram, Kapa, Raipur; the
                                Second took place from November 18 -21, 2003 at Pallotti Ashram, Kapa, Raipur itself.
                                Again the Third Regional Assembly was held from 12 – 14 October 2006 at Regional House,
                                Amaseoni, Raipur and the Fourth Regional Assembly was convened from 24 – 26 November
                                2009 at Shanti Niwas, Bilaspur. Added to these there were two Regional Congresses held
                                at Pallotti Ashram, Raipur. And then, once the Regional House, Jyoti Niwas was built the
                                successive 3rd Regional Assembly and 3rd Regional Congress were held there. These
                                conventions served as an occasion to enable to set goals, to envision visions and pave a
                                solid path to march ahead united and fuelled with brotherly love towards success and
                                development. Consequently, successive years witnessed a real commencement of growth and
                                development.
