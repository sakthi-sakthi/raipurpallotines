                            <h4> In 1835, Pallotti formed a community of priests and brothers which he called the
                                “Society of the Catholic Apostolate(SAC)” (Societas Apostolatus Catholici). After the
                                death of St. Vincent in 1850, the Society faced some difficulties with regard to the
                                name of the Society. When Pallotti’s last defender, Cardinal Lambruscini, died in 1854,
                                the name of the Society was abruptly changed to “The Pious Society of Missions”. This
                                lasted until 1947 and then “by a gracious act of the Holy See” the original name of the
                                Society was restored.</h4>

                                St. Vincent Pallotti challenges us to see the image of the Holy Trinity in all people.
                                This objective can be achieved through an encounter and being together with others. In
                                this process, God’s commitment to his people in love is to become tangible reality in
                                the light of the biblical stories and the life of Jesus Christ. Besides this, we
                                encounter the same presence of God everywhere in varied situations of life daily through
                                devoted time for reflection and prayer. In addition , the challenge to experience God
                                lies in combining the different phases of work: community life, prayer life, and an
                                active contemplative life etc. God would give Himself always and everywhere in His
                                infinite love if humans did not limit Him. One can experience this love by absorbing
                                God’s love for the world and trying to give oneself- not only by doing and giving
                                something, but giving all and with it oneself.
                            </h4>

                            <h4>
                                Involving everyone in ministry, valuing and promoting abilities and gifts of others are
                                all a part of the Pallottine profile. The diversity of people reveals about God and his
                                image after which every human being is fashioned in a unique way. Hence, no two human
                                beings are exactly the same. Such an appreciation of diversity of persons is found in
                                the New Testament at the Pentecost scene where women and men are seen praying together.
                                The Spirit goes far beyond the space in which people are praying – the Spirit blows
                                wherever it, pleases. St. Vincent Pallotti wanted a community –[…]fashioned in such a
                                way, that all Catholics, clergy and lay people, men and women, educated and uneducated,
                                rich and poor, nobles and commoners, irrespective of their status, their profession and
                                their wealth can take part in it. The community characterized by such an openness and
                                diversity provides a firm foundation for different expressions of life. In the Society
                                of the Catholic Apostolate, priests and brothers live and work together. This
                                togetherness is built on the wealth of Christian tradition. St. Vincent Pallotti, who
                                had vast knowledge of the history of spirituality, gave an expression to the
                                spirituality that invites everyone to be an apostle. He was ahead of his time in
                                recognizing this vocation. He broke new ground and gave his community the task of being
                                imaginative and innovative in exercising ministry for the glory of God and the salvation
                                of all.
                            </h4>

                            <h4>
                                The Pallottiine Spirituality levels the boundaries of separation in working for the
                                Kingdom of God. Being a Christian means doing away with differences and being united in
                                the apostolate. St. Vincent Pallotti challenges us to respond to God’s infinite love in
                                a boundless way. Therefore, the Pallottine ministries can be found at the heart as well
                                as on the margins of the Church’s ministries, on the periphery of society. In leadership
                                positions, and in science and research. The Pallottines place themselves at the service
                                of uniting human family as tools and instruments. This is the central mission of the
                                Church after the Second Vatican Council. Creating networks and collaboration are the
                                characteristic features of the Pallottine mission. Collaboration is not limited to
                                members and friends or to Catholics, but it goes far beyond; it invites all people of
                                goodwill in executing God’s plan. This attitude of openness leads to dialogue, even if
                                the other is closed. We must always be open to such dialogue and relationship.
