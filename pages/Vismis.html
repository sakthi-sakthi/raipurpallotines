                            <h4>
                                During the first half of the 19th century, St. Vincent Pallotti was among those whom God
                                enriched with his gifts and inspiration for the purpose of helping the Church to fulfill
                                her mission. Faced with the worsening crisis of faith that the Church of his time had to
                                confront and the ever-increasing tasks for the spreading of the Gospel in mission
                                territories, Saint Vincent Pallotti saw the urgent need to revive faith and renew
                                charity among Catholics, with the intention of bringing all people to the unity of faith
                                in Christ. To respond to this need, he considered it indispensable to secure the
                                collaboration of all the members of the Church, both clergy and laity, and to unify
                                their efforts in order to promote with greater effectiveness her apostolic mission.
                            </h4>

                            <h3>MISSION</h3>
                            <h4>
                                Like every association within the Catholic Church, the Society of the Catholic
                                Apostolate has a specific mission, given by the founder. During the 170 years of its
                                existence, Pallotti’s foundation had to face many challenging situations. After Vatican
                                Council II, the Society took upon itself the responsibility to redefine its mission,
                                taking into account the original ideas of the Founder, its historical development and
                                the actual needs of the Church. The most important “reason of being” of the Society is
                                that it has in common with the mission of Jesus Christ and of the Church, that is, “to
                                revive faith and re-enkindle charity of the entire people of God and to spread faith and
                                charity in the world, so that soon there may be but one flock and one shepherded’ (John
                                10,16). This general mission, common with the whole Church, gets its specific imprint by
                                Pallotti’s idea of the “catholic”, universal apostolate, which for St. Vincent Pallotti
                                became the guiding idea of his activities. Such a concept of mission presupposes that
                                every one is called to follow Jesus Christ and to shoulder his/her responsibility for
                                the mission of the Church, to instill in all a profound conviction of their personal
                                call to be a disciple of Jesus Christ and inspire them for a life with and for Christ.
                                Generally we can say that the mission of the Society is to increase the collaboration
                                among the among the members of the Church, that is, among the diocesan priests, the male
                                and female religious and the laity to fulfill fully and more efficiently the apostolic
                                tasks.
